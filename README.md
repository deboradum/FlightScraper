THE RYAN SCRAPER IS CURRENTLY BROKEN DUE TO CHANGES IN THEIR WEBSITE.

This program scans all possible options on RyanAir & WizzAir for the cheapest flights.
This is one of my first projects created when I first started coding, so the code is in
many ways not optimal or good.

Because I like cheap travelling, I created this program to find cheap flights to around
Europe. Settings such as the departing city, destination and duration can be manually
changed.
